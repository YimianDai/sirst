Single-frame InfraRed Small Target (SIRST) Benchmark
==============

A dataset proposed in "Asymmetric Contextual Modulation for Infrared Small Target Detection" <https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14530>

## Dataset Description

SIRST is a dataset specially constructed for **single-frame** infrared small target detection, in which the images are selected from hundreds of infrared sequences for different scenarios.

## Learderboard

The full learderboard will come soon. 
A comparison of 19 methods can be found at <https://github.com/YimianDai/open-acm>.

## Toolkit

The full toolkit will come soon. 
Some implementations of our proposed methods can be found at [DENTIST](https://github.com/YimianDai/DENTIST), [ACM](https://github.com/YimianDai/open-acm), and [ALCNet](https://github.com/YimianDai/open-alcnet).
